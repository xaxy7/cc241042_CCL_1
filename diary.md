total work: around 10/11 hours

At first I worked with the most basic template.
I implemented my own collision detection and physics engine(gravity). However, there were some issues with collision 
(while colliding, the movement of the player wasn't fluid)
I've spend the rest of the day trying to implement physics again, however the result weren't promising 
(I fixed the original issue, but others apeared).

total work around 11 hours

For the first half of the day I worked with the code from the last day. I again managed to implement physics from scratch.
However there apeared a weird issue, when the detection wouldn't always trigger. After consulting the problem with 2 diffrent tutors,
they realised that the issue comes from the way browser works, and I can't really do much about it, without making drastic changes to the code.
That's when I decided to finally use the ready template, with already implemented gravity.

The other part of the day I've spent on improving the template to my liking. I tweaked the jump force and gravity to fit my game.
I fixed some glitches in the template (the player was able to jump while in the air). Later I implemented several classes:
-coins(placeholder for collectable, if touched they disapear and increase the score)
-enemies(placeholders, they move randomly, if player touches them, he disapears)

At morning I implemented weapon class. The weapons lie on the ground and if the player picks them up they are able to shoot.
As bullets I implemented projectile class. If the projectile touches an enemy, the enemy disapears. If they touch a block, they disapear.

Later I worked on introducing horizontal and horizontal view shift, based on the movement of the player.
Right now (2pm) I have a working horizontal shift. I have, however I don't actively use, a partialy working vertical view shift.
There are some issues with it, and I will need help from the tutor to fix it. 

I adjusted the horizontal shift and decided to scrap(for now) the vertical shift. I added more enemy types (flying one).
I made the basic layout for the level, added more platforms, coins etc. I introduced a placeholder for the starting screen

Missing features:
game finish trigger, restarting the game, maybe: lava, power-ups.
